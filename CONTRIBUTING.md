# Setting things up:

    2.Fork the repository.
    3.Copy it to your machine via any method you like.
# How to add new patterns:
    1.Each Pattern's code should be kept within a function.Function names should be that shape or quality or characteristics it represents.
    2.Each function should be written in it's own .c file.
    3.Add the function's protype in main_shape.
    4.Add the function in the main_shape.c file's case  section.
    5.All same shape's files should be kept in a same folder having the name of the main_shape.
    6.Each function may have an argument which can be used to determine no of lines of the pattern.
    7.All patterns should be checked replacing "<function_name>" in test.c file.
    8.Add the Compiler command in the Makefile for each new .c file.
# Creating Pull Requests:
    1.Make sure you pushed to the right branch of your repository.
    2.Create a pull request with a Effective Title.
    3.Explain your changes in description.
