# Setting things up:
    1.Install and set-up any C Compiler (gcc preferred).
    2.Fork the repository.
    3.Copy it to your machine via any method you like.
# How to add new patterns:
    1.Each Pattern's code should be kept within a function.Function names should be that shape or quality or characteristics it represents.
    2.Each function may have an argument which can be used to determine no of lines of the pattern.
    3.Patterns of same shape should be kept in same .c file.For example, all triangle or pyramid patterns should be kept
      in triangle.c or pyramid.c.
    4.All libraries or header file which is used in most of the patterns (ex- stdio.h) should be included in system.h .
    5.All patterns should be checked replacing "<function_name>" in test.c file.
# Creating Pull Requests:
    1.Make sure you pushed to the right branch of your repository.
    2.Create a pull request with a Effective Title.
    3.Explain your changes in description.
    4.Attach a screen shot of your Pattern.
